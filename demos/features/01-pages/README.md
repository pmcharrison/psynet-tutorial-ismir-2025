# Simple rating experiment

## Overview

This is a demo of a simple rating experiment using the PsyNet framework.
We present participants with a series of stimuli, one at a time, and ask them to rate the stimulus on one or more numeric scales.

In this demo, the stimuli are instrument sounds, which we store within the `data/instrument_sounds` directory.
We have participants rate these sounds for brightness and roughness.
