# Whenever you edit this file, you should run `bash constraints.sh generate`
# to update the repository's constraints.txt files.

# Note: This requirements.txt file is written to cover the whole
# psynet-tutorial-ismir-2025 repository, not just individual demos.
# If you were deploying one of these demos, you would update this requirements.txt
# file to only include the dependencies for that demo.

# We are pinning to some specific commits for PsyNet/Dallinger which
# have unmerged changes.
