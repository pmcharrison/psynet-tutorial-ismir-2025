Prerequisites
=============

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with Python and have a basic familiarity with the command line.
If you are new to Python, we recommend you take a look at the
`Python's Getting Started page <https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/>`_.
If you are new to the command line, we recommend you take a look at the
`Software Carpentry's Command Line tutorial <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/>`_.

For trying the exercises in this tutorial, we recommend using GitHub Codespaces,
a cloud-based development environment that is quick to set up and requires
no local installation of software. All you need for this is a GitHub account.
