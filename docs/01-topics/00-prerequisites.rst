Prerequisites
=============

Knowledge
---------

This tutorial assumes some familiarity with **Python**.
In particular, you should be familiar with Python's class system, inheritance,
and list comprehensions.
If you are new to Python, we recommend you take a look at the
`Python's Getting Started page <https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/>`_.

You should also be familiar with the **command line**.
If you are new to the command line, we recommend you take a look at the
`Software Carpentry's Command Line tutorial <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/>`_.

Software
--------

For trying the exercises in this tutorial, we recommend using **GitHub Codespaces**,
a cloud-based development environment that is quick to set up and requires
no local installation of software.
All you need for this is a `GitHub account <https://github.com/>`_.
We will show you how to set up a Codespace at the relevant point in the tutorial.

Please also make sure you have **Google Chrome** installed,
as we currently only support Chrome as a participant browser.
