Where next?
===========

If you've made it through all these chapters, you're pretty much a PsyNet expert. Congratulations!

Deploying an experiment to a web server requires some additional steps
that we have not covered in this tutorial.
For information on these topics, please visit the `main PsyNet documentation website <https://psynet.dev>`_.

That documentation website also contains a range of other tutorials about different PsyNet topics.
You could for example be interested in learning more about
`graphics in PsyNet <https://psynetdev.gitlab.io/PsyNet/tutorials/graphics.html>`_,
or how to `synchronize multiple participants <https://psynetdev.gitlab.io/PsyNet/tutorials/synchronization.html>`_
to produce multiplayer paradigms,
or how to support `multiple languages in PsyNet experiments <https://psynetdev.gitlab.io/PsyNet/tutorials/internationalization.html>`_.
That documentation website is still work-in-progress, but we hope to polish it off soon.

We welcome your questions and feedback. Please feel free to write to Peter Harrison (pmch2@cam.ac.uk)
and Nori Jacoby (kj338@cornell.edu) with thoughts and suggestions.
