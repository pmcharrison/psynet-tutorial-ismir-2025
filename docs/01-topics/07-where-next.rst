Where next?
===========

With these preceding chapters, you've learned all you need to implement
sophisticated audio experiments in PsyNet. Congratulations!

Deploying an experiment to a web server requires some additional steps
that we have not covered in this tutorial.
For information on these topics, please visit the `main PsyNet documentation website <https://psynet.dev>`_.

This documentation website also contains a range of other tutorials about different PsyNet topics.
You could for example be interested in learning more about
`graphics in PsyNet <https://psynetdev.gitlab.io/PsyNet/tutorials/graphics.html>`_
or how to `synchronize multiple participants <https://psynetdev.gitlab.io/PsyNet/tutorials/synchronization.html>`_
to produce multiplayer paradigms.
The documentation is still work-in-progress, but we hope to update it soon and merge in the content developed in this tutorial.

We welcome your questions and feedback. Please feel free to write to Peter Harrison (pmch2@cam.ac.uk)
and Nori Jacoby (kj338@cornell.edu) with thoughts and suggestions.
