PsyNet @ ISMIR 2025
===================

Welcome to the PsyNet tutorial at ISMIR 2025!
We are excited to share our software with you.

PsyNet is a Python platform for designing and running sophisticated online experiments.
In this tutorial we want to give you a taste of the experiments that PsyNet facilitates,
and to give you some hands-on experience with the software.

The tutorial will begin with a spoken presentation where we'll introduce PsyNet
and talk about various case studies that use it.
You can find the slides `here <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NiqhVrmHRJQQ2LygDcM9U2Zye0zOMZK6mPrkcu949uo>`_.

In the latter part of the session we'll get you started with PsyNet.
We've put together a step-by-step tutorial, hosted on this website,
that will teach you the key concepts of PsyNet
and put you in a position to design your own sophisticated online experiments.

We're also keen to get your feedback on the software.
We hope you might be able to complete a short survey once the session is over.

We hope you enjoy the tutorial!
