Static experiments (I)
======================

In PsyNet, we define a *static experiment* as an experiment where the stimuli
(or, more technically, the 'nodes') stay fixed over time.
Many experiments fit into this mould, including many of our demos:

- :doc:`01-simple-rating <../02-demos/01-simple-rating>`: Participants rate audio stimuli for specified attributes;
- :doc:`02-tapping <../02-demos/02-tapping>`: Participants tap to the beat of musical stimuli;
- :doc:`04-similarity <../02-demos/04-similarity>`: Participants rate the similarity of audio stimuli;
- :doc:`05-timed-push-buttons <../02-demos/05-timed-push-buttons>`: Participants press buttons at interesting moments in audio stimuli.

.. note::

    In the :doc:`03-step-tag <../02-demos/03-step-tag>` demo,
    the stimuli comprise not only audio files but also the tags generated by previous participants.
    This means that it is not a static paradigm, but rather a 'chain' paradigm.

This exercise will introduce you to the key concepts of static experiments.
